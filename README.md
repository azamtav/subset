======

You will be given a data file. The first line of the data file will have a target price. The following lines contain a menu of dishes.

Write a program to read in the data file and find any combination of dishes that add up exactly to the target price specified on the first line of the data file. If there is no solution, your program should specify that there is no combination of dishes that will be equal in cost to the target price.

== Assumptions ==
* The menu can have duplicate priced items
* The menu items will all be greater than $0
* The total price will be greater than or equal to $0
